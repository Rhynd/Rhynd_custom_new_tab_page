# Privacy Policy for Rhynd's Custom New Tab Page

**Last Updated:** `09/05/2026`

Thank you for using Rhynd's Custom New Tab Page. This privacy policy explains what information the extension accesses and how it is used. Your privacy is important to us, and this extension is designed to be as transparent as possible.

## Summary

This extension **does not** collect, store, or sell any of your personal data. All data accessed is used locally within your browser to provide the extension's features or is transmitted to trusted third-party services (Google) as described below to enable core functionality.

## Information We Access Locally

To provide its features, the extension needs permission to access certain data stored locally in your browser. This data is not sent to the developer.

1.  **Browsing History (`history` permission)**:
    *   **Why?** To provide relevant suggestions from your past browsing as you type in the search bar. This also allows you to remove specific pages from your history directly from the suggestions list.
    *   **Usage:** Your history is queried locally. You have direct control to delete items via the UI.

2.  **Most Visited Sites (`topSites` permission)**:
    *   **Why?** To display a grid of "Quick Links" to your most frequently visited websites on the new tab page for convenient access.
    *   **Usage:** The extension reads your top sites and displays them.

3.  **Bookmarks (`bookmarks` permission)**:
    *   **Why?** To provide relevant suggestions from your saved bookmarks as you type in the search bar.
    *   **Usage:** Your bookmarks are queried locally to be included in the search suggestions. The extension only reads bookmark data; it does not modify or delete your bookmarks.

4.  **Network Request Modification (`declarativeNetRequest` permission)**:
    *   **Why?** To ensure that search suggestions from Google are fetched correctly and securely.
    *   **Usage:** The extension uses this permission to apply a rule that modifies the Google suggestion service URL. This is a secure method that does not involve reading or intercepting the content of your network traffic.

5.  **Local Storage (`storage` and `unlimitedStorage` permissions)**:
    *   **Why?** To allow you to upload and save a custom background image for your new tab page.
    *   **Usage:** The image you upload is converted and saved entirely locally within your browser's extension storage. This data never leaves your device and is not sent to any external server.


## Information Transmitted to Third Parties

Certain features require sending data to external services. This is limited to what is necessary for the feature to work.

1.  **Google Search Suggestions**:
    *   **What is sent?** The text you type into the search bar.
    *   **Where is it sent?** To Google's suggestion service (`suggestqueries.google.com`).
    *   **Why?** To fetch real-time search suggestions, similar to how Chrome's omnibox works.

2.  **Search Execution**:
    *   **What is sent?** Your search query.
    *   **Where is it sent?** To Google Search (`google.com`).
    *   **Why?** To perform a search when you submit the search form.

3.  **Opening Google Gemini**:
    *   **What is sent?** No data is sent automatically. Clicking the Gemini icon opens the Google Gemini website in a new tab.
    *   **Where is it sent?** To Google Gemini (`gemini.google.com`).
    *   **Why?** To provide a convenient shortcut to Google's AI chat service.


## Data Security

The extension operates entirely within your browser. No personal data is ever collected or stored on any server controlled by the developer. The transmission of data to third-party services like Google is handled over secure HTTPS connections.
