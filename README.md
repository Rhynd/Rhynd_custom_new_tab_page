# Rhynd's Custom New Tab Page Extension

This is a browser extension that overrides the default new tab page with a custom, feature-rich start page. It is designed with a dark, clean aesthetic inspired by Chrome's "Citron" theme and features a background from the game Star Citizen.

## Features

*   **Unified Search Bar**: Search Google or type a URL directly. The input field automatically detects whether your query is a search term or a web address.
*   **Dynamic Suggestions**: As you type, a dropdown appears with a combined list of:
    *   **Google Search Suggestions**: Real-time suggestions from Google.
    *   **Browser Bookmarks**: Your saved bookmarks appear for quick access.
    *   **Browser History**: Matching pages from your browsing history.
    *   **Grouped History**: History items from the same domain are grouped into a single, expandable entry for a cleaner look.
*   **Quick Links**: Displays a grid of your top 8 most visited websites for one-click access.
*   **Gemini Shortcut**: A dedicated button to quickly open Google Gemini (left-click for current tab, middle-click for new tab).
*   **History Management**: You can remove a specific page or an entire group of pages from your browser history directly from the suggestions list.
*   **Full Keyboard Accessibility**: Navigate and control the entire new tab page using only your keyboard.
*   **Modern & Responsive Design**: A clean, dark theme that is easy on the eyes, with a layout that works well on different screen sizes.
*   **Custom Background**: Hover over the bottom-right corner to reveal a hidden settings button. Click it to upload your own custom background image, or right-click it to instantly reset to the default Star Citizen wallpaper.
